            The first week of the season is a "most" week, and the following week is a "least" week.
            This pattern alternates until the playoffs begin, at which point the most and least points no longer matter.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If your team scores the most points of all teams during a most week, you win <b>$10</b>.</li>
            <li>If your team scores the least points of all teams during a least week, you win <b>$10</b>.</li>
            <li>If your team scores exactly 50 points, you win exactly <b>$50</b>.</li>
            <li>If your team wins a playoff game, you win <b>$10</b>.</li>
            <li>If your team wins the Super Bowl, you win <b>$25</b>.</li>
            <li>For making this website, Matt gets <b>$10,000</b>! (Pending grandparents' approval.)</li>
        </ol>
        <p align="left">
            If multiple teams share a winning score during a most or least week, all teams sharing the winning score win.
