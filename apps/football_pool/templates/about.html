                    The first week of the season is a "most" week, and the following week is a "least" week.
                    This pattern alternates until the playoffs begin, at which point the most and least points no longer matter.

                    <li>If your team scores the most points of all teams during a most week, you win <b>$10</b>.</li>
                    <li>If your team scores the least points of all teams during a least week, you win <b>$10</b>.</li>
                    <li>If your team scores exactly 50 points, you win exactly <b>$50</b>.</li>

                    If multiple teams share a winning score during a most or least week, all teams sharing the winning score win.
